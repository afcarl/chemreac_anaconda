Conda recipes for chemreac
==========================
See conda.anaconda.org/chemreac

How to build the recipes
------------------------
The examples below relies on `dockre <https://github.com/bjodah/dockre>`_ for simplicity (``pip install --user dockre``)

::

   $ ./build.sh

And thats it, the packages are then uploaded manually from ``./output/`` using ``anaconda upload``.
